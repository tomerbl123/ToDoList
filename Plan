What I did last week?
- Changed the project into MVC structure (still not perfect, by WAY better).
- Created __init__.py file because of circular imports issue. Now this file defines the app and db and we just call it.
- Switched the .HTML file into HTML String, now it's more dynamic (changes according to the amount of data that we have).
- Completely finished with the Homepage and Create_Taks options.
- Fixed a major bug. After every Create_Task we were "stuck" at the /creating endpoint so every Refresh send the POST request again (used
  redirect option to Homepage after each task creation).
- Done with the Update and Delete options.
- Design improvements.
- Separated the tasks table into 2 different table (done and not).

What are the next steps?
- Start using Git (cmd).
- Add Register and Login page.
- Add Users table (and show the tasks accordingly)
- Add logs?
- Add tests?
- Improving the structure.
