What I did last week?
- read about python packages and modules.
- installed git and connected it with github (need to start using it, a little complicated. used https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
- created HTML file (instead of a function that holds the text).
- removed some unnecessary functions and unified some.
- added Login page.
- added Register page.
- added User table with foreign_key to the tasks.
- created user session (after login, each user sees his own tasks + can't go to specific URLs without Login first).
- logout button and logic.
- minor CSS changes - MORE TO COME!
- removed status option for new tasks.

What's next?
- improve CSS
- improve the tasks per user design - use modal and not table with numbers.
- remove the numbers logic, atm the user inserts task's number that he want to edit (we can insert other users tasks this way..).
- bug fix: If there are no users at all -> the auth() will fail (no password[0][0]).
- add password hashing.     
- create views.py file and move all the routes to be there.
- find a solution for hardcoded URIs (settings file?).
- remove the __init__ file and find a better solution.
- Add admin page.
- algorithm - how long the task is in the system without any change.
