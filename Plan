What I did last week?
- read about python packages and modules.
- installed git and connected it with github (need to start using it, a little complicated. used https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
- created HTML file (instead of a function that holds the text).
- removed some unnecessary functions and unified some.


What are the next steps?
- Start using Git (cmd).
- Add Register and Login page.
- Add Users table (and show the tasks accordingly)
- Add logs?
- Add tests?
- Improving the structure.
