What I did last week?
- Created URL to each call (sort of improvement to the CRUD functions that I did last week, because there's 
  nothing to do with them this way..).
- Tested each endpoint with POSTMAN - GREAT SUCCESS!
- Started HTML and CSS short course (done with most of the HTML part).
- built a tiny homepage to start working with (E2E).
- Integrated the POST call to the Server.

What are the next steps?
- Improve the homepage appearance (Adding buttons, text fields and Tasks table).
- Finish with the Update, Delete and Getalltasks end points (according to the homepage's changes).
- Finish the CSS part of the course (~1-2 hours).
- Design the homepage (for fun.).

In the far future??
- Add Register and Login page.
- Add Users table.
- Show the tasks according to the relevant user.
- Add logs?
- Add tests?
- Improving the structure?
