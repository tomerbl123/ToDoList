The difficulties that I had so far:
- Understanding the difference between SQLAlchemy and Sqlite3.
- Creating a new DB using SQLAlchemy (why I had to use it? what are the advantages of using it and not sqlite commands directly?).
  it took me around 4-5hours to do so (had a hard time with the syntax and everything, very hard to understand it).
- Using the Command Line for everything that i need (even pip install). Installing new packages, defining python3 in the path (instead of
  python2, which took me a while to understand that im using the wrong version because i forgot to add python3 to the path after installing
  it) and pip3 as well.
- Using Git.
- What should be the structure of the project? What's the smartest thing to start with? (decided to go with the Server first, first of all
  creating the databse than the functions that run it and then the UI).
  
Questions that I have:
- I still don't understand what's the right structure of the project, what models should I create? what goes where (db, user's actions..).
- What exactly I should show every Sunday? and how? because there's not real server here, I'm just executing it locally to test it.
